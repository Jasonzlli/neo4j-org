    			<p>Neo4j is commercial software. Proven in production since 2003, powering applications from global 
    			collaborative websites to in-house experiments, Neo4j is used in diverse environments. Neo Technology 
    			makes Neo4j available under a dual-license arrangement that is business friendly and open-source 
    			transparent: the Neo Technology Commercial License (NTCL), or the (A)GPL.</p>
    			<p>There are 3 editions of Neo4j:</p>
    			<ul>
      			<li>Neo4j Enterprise, which includes Online Backup, High Availability Clustering, and Advanced Monitoring</li>
      			<li>Neo4j Advanced, with Advanced Monitoring</li>
      			<li>Neo4j Community, a High Performance, fully ACID Transactional Graph Database</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p><strong>Which license is right for you?</strong> That depends on how you&#8217;re using Neo4j.</p>
    			<h3 dir="ltr">You build Closed Source, Business-Essential Online Applications</h3>
    			<p>If you&#8217;re using Neo4j to build closed-source online applications that are central to your business, 
    			then you&#8217;ll want to talk to us about commercial licensing of Neo4j Advanced or Enterprise editions. 
    			These offer the monitoring, backup and high-availability features you&#8217;ll need to be successful &#8211; 
    			not to mention access to support from our top engineering team.</p>
    			<p>If you don&#8217;t need any of the reliability features in the Advanced or Enterprise editions, then 
    			you&#8217;re free to use the Community edition of Neo4j Server under a GPL license &#8211; which means you 
    			can use it anywhere you would use something like MySQL. Used in this way, only changes you make to the Neo4j 
    			software itself should be open-sourced and shared with the community.</p>
          <h3 dir="ltr">You want to embed Neo4j as an OEM component in your Closed Source software</h3>
          <p>Neo4j is a great choice when you need to include a graph database service in your packaged 
          software product. Â We can make Neo4j available to use in these situations under our commercial OEM licensing &#8211; 
          contact us for details.</p>
          <h3 dir="ltr">You are Testing or Evaluating Neo4j</h3>
          <p>All editions of Neo4j are available for <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/download">download</a> and can be used 
          under open source licenses &#8211; perfect for testing and evaluating Neo4j before you&#8217;ve released your 
          code or made your new online service available to your customers.</p>
          <h3 dir="ltr">You are developing Open Source Software</h3>
          <p>We love open source development: so you are free to use all Neo4j components for your open source, public 
          domain project under either the GPL (for Community editions) or the AGPL (for Advanced and Enterprise editions).</p>
