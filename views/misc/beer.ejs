                <h1>Everybody loves beer.</h1>

                <p>There is a high density of beer-loving geeks in the neo4j community. Below are some of
                    the projects and
                    resources tht have been developed with or around Neo4j.</p>
                <blockquote>A traditional relational database may tell you the average
                    age of everyone in this pub, but
                    a graph database will tell you who is most likely to buy you a beer. <i>Andreas Kollegger</i></blockquote>
                <p>
                    Of course, we are sponsoring beer for the <a href="/participate/meetups">Neo4j Meetups</a>, so drop by!
